This is a simulation of the card game The Mind. It's a rare case where Sleep Sort is both the ideal and only solution. Players are dealt a number of unique cards between 1 and 100 inclusive. They must then play those cards in order without any communication. This implementation solves that by having eacy player wait for a given time slice multipled by the number on their card. It works accurately as long as the time slices are large enough to prevent them from stepping on eachother, down to a factor of 0.004 seconds. Interestingly the results can get more granular without the use of a threadsafe collection.
